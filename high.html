<h3>Water Vapor Match in the Tropical Tropopause Layer</h3>
<p>We apply the match technique, whereby the same air mass is 
observed more than once (termed as a "match"), to study the 
dehydration process associated with horizontal advection in the 
Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) over the western Pacific. 
The matches are obtained from the SOWER campaign network 
observations during northern winters of 2004-2009 using 
isentropic trajectories (Figure 1). For the matches identified, 
extensive screening procedures are performed to verify 
the representativeness of the air parcel and the validity 
of the isentropic treatment and to check for possible water 
injection by deep convection and consistency between 
the sonde data and analysis field. Among the matches that 
passed these screening tests, some of the matches indicated 
a decrease in the amount of water vapor between the first 
and second observations of the water vapor mixing ratio 
(Figure 2). This finding represents the first direct evidence 
of dehydration associated with horizontal advection in the TTL. <br />

the first and second circular areas (i.e., those centered at Tarawa

therefore, they represent a match air parcel (see text for details). 
The footprints are drawn every 24 hour. The air parcel observed 
over Tarawa on 27 December 2004 (first observation) was observed 
again (second observation) over R/V Mirai after about 5 days.

<h3>Volcanic Aerosols and Cirrus</h3>
<p>A Mie-scattering depolarization lidar has been operated at Biak, 
Indonesia during SOWER campaigns to observe cirrus variations 
in the TTL. Figure 3 shows a very interesting case where cirrus 
clouds exist within an aerosol layer originated probably 
from a volcanic eruption (Mount Merapi, Indonesia, in October 2010). 
Analysis of lidar data together with data from balloon-borne 
optical particle counters and CFH suggests that cirrus clouds formed 
with solid sulfate particles in tropical upper troposphere.<br />

on 12 January 2011. (b) Time-altitude plot of particle 
depolarization ratio at 532 nm. The depolarization by the aerosol 
layer was very small or not detectable. At 03:00 to 06:00 LT, 
enhanced depolarization was seen at the altitudes 
between 17.5 and 18 km. The depolarization at these altitudes is 
as large as 0.5. (c) Time-height plot of color ratio (CR) 
on 12 January. The cirrus cloud layer shows a CR similar to 
that of the lower cirrus clouds. CR in the aerosol layer 
is smaller than 1, a value typical for aerosols.</p>

<h3>Decadal Variations of Water Vapor in the Tropical Lower Stratosphere</h3>
<p>Water vapor variations in the tropical lower stratosphere were 
investigated on seasonal, quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), 
and decadal time scales using balloon-borne cryogenic 
frost point hygrometer data taken between 1993 and 2009 
during various campaigns including the Central Equatorial Pacific 
Experiment (March 1993), campaigns once or twice annually during 
the SOWER project in the eastern Pacific (1998–2003) and 
in the western Pacific and Southeast Asia (2001–2009), 
and the Ticosonde campaigns and regular sounding at Costa Rica 
(2005–2009). Figure 4 shows time series of cryogenic frost point 
hygrometer data averaged in a lower stratospheric layer 
together with two satellite datasets (the Halogen Occultation 
Experiment (HALOE) and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)), 
showing the existence of decadal variations: The mixing ratios 
were higher and increasing in the 1990s, lower in the early 2000s, 
and probably slightly higher again or recovering after 2004.<br />

the SOWER and Ticosonde campaigns and 10N-10S satellite HALOE

and open stars indicate SOWER CFH campaign averages. 
Closed triangles indicate Ticosonde CFH monthly averages. 
Closed circles colored pink indicate HALOE monthly averages 
(sunrise and sunset data are mixed), and closed squares colored 
light blue indicate MLS monthly averages. Vertical bars show the 
standard error of the mean. For satellite data, the bars are 
generally smaller than the symbols in size.
